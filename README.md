# OmniAuth YahooJp [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-yahoojp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-yahoojp)

**These notes are based on master, please see tags for README pertaining to specific releases.**

This is the official OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Yahoo! JAPAN( [YConnect](http://developer.yahoo.co.jp/yconnect/v2/) ).
To use it, you'll need to sign up for a YConnect Client ID and Secret
on the [Yahoo! JAPAN Developer Network](https://e.developer.yahoo.co.jp/dashboard/).

Supports OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flows. Read the Yahoo!JAPAN docs for more details: https://developer.yahoo.co.jp/yconnect/v2/

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`: 

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-yahoo-jp'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Basic Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::YahooJp` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

YConnect API v2 lets you set scopes to provide granular access to different types of data: 

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :yahoo_jp, ENV['YAHOOJP_KEY'], ENV['YAHOOJP_SECRET'], 
    {
        scope: "openid profile email address"
    }
end
```

## Advanced Parameters

You can also set :display, :prompt, :scope, :bail parameter to specify behavior of sign-in and permission page.
More info on [YConnect](http://developer.yahoo.co.jp/yconnect/v2/).

For example, to request `openid`, `profile`,  and `email` permissions and display the authentication page in a popup window:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :yahoo_jp, ENV['YAHOOJP_KEY'], ENV['YAHOOJP_SECRET'], 
    {
        scope: "openid profile email",
        display: "popup"
    }
end
```

### API Version

OmniAuth YahooJp uses versioned API endpoints by default (current v2). You can configure a different version via `client_options` hash passed to `provider`, specifically you should change the version in the `site` and `authorize_url` parameters. For example, to change to v1:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :yahoo_jp, ENV['YAHOOJP_KEY'], ENV['YAHOOJP_SECRET'], 
    {
        scope: "openid profile email address",
        client_options: {
            authorize_url: '/yconnect/v1/authorization',
            token_url: '/yconnect/v1/token'
        }
    }
end
```
